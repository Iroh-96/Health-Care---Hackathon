# Health-Care---Hackathon
The healthcare sector has long been an early adopter of and benefited greatly from technological advances. These days, machine learning plays a key role in many health-related realms, including the development of new medical procedures, the handling of patient data, health camps and records and the treatment of chronic diseases. MedCamp organizes health camps in several cities with low work life balance. They reach out to working people and ask them to register for these health camps. For those who attend, MedCamp provides them facility to undergo health checks or increase awareness by visiting various stalls (depending on the format of camp).   MedCamp has conducted 65 such events over a period of 4 years and they see a high drop off between “Registration” and Number of people taking tests at the Camps. In last 4 years, they have stored data of ~110,000 registrations they have done.  One of the huge costs in arranging these camps is the amount of inventory you need to carry. If you carry more than required inventory, you incur unnecessarily high costs. On the other hand, if you carry less than required inventory for conducting these medical checks, people end up having bad experience.
